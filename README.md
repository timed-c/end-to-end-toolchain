# The Timed C E2E Toolchain
The Timed C E2E is a pragmatic toolchain that takes as input a Timed C program and performs temporal (schedulability and sensitivity) analysis on the program.  The Timed C E2E  toolchain integrates :

1. [KTC source-to-source compiler](https://github.com/timed-c/ktc): A source to source compiler for compiling Timed C program to target specific C code.
2. [Schedulability test tool ](https://github.com/brandenburg/np-schedulability-analysis): A tool that performs  schedulability tests for sets of non-preemptive jobs.
3. [Sensitivity analysis tool ](https://github.com/saranya-natarajan/end-to-end-toolchain/tree/master/sensitivity-analysis): A tool that computes the weakly hard constraint of a system w.r.t WCET margins.


 The Timed C E2E toolchain takes as input a Timed C program and does the following steps in order: 
 
  1.	_KTC Profiling_ : performs measurement-based WCET estimations using the KTC profiler. The KTC profiler is an extension of the KTC compiler.  It takes as input a Timed C program and generates an instrumented C program. It then automatically compiles this instrumented C code and calculates the WCET.  It uses this information to generate input for the next step. 
  2.   _Schedulability Test_ : uses this estimates to perform schedulability test.  The  tool also supports uniprocessor analysis with abort actions, which forcefully stops and discards a job's execution at its deadline. 
  3.  _Sensitivity Analysis_ : based on the ouput from the previous step it performs temporal sensitivity analysis. It calculates the maximum scaling factor and _M_ for a given _k_

## Installing Timed C E2E toolchain
The Timed C e2e toolchain is packed as an docker image. This makes the e2e toochain portable across different operating systems. This document describe how to install the e2e toolchain as a docker  image. This  docker container  is known to work on Ubuntu, Linux, and Windows machines.


### Installing Docker
If the docker sofware is installed on your machine please skip this step. Otherwise, follow the instruction below

##### For Windows

https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/

##### For Ubuntu

https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/

##### For Mac OS

https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/

### Installing the Timed C E2E Docker  Image

1. Clone from the Timed C E2E repo
		
		git clone https://github.com/saranya-natarajan/end-to-end-toolchain.git
		
2. Enter the working directory  and fetch submodules
	
		cd end-to-end-toolchain
		git submodule init
		git submodule update
If you get a error on update please use the below command
		
		git submodule update --force --recursive --init --remote 
		
3. Build the E2E docker image. This will take few minutes. 
		
		docker build --no-cache --tag=e2e .

## Updating the Timed C E2E Toolchain
Note : do this only after your initial installation is done successfully.

1. Pull from the Timed C E2E repo

		git pull

3. Enter the working directory  and fetch update submodules

		git submodule update

2. Re-build the E2E docker image

		<path-to-end-to-end-toolchain>/end2end --end
		docker build --no-cache --tag=e2e .

## Running the toolcahin

Run the docker image 
	
	<path-to-end-to-end-toolchain>/end2end --init
